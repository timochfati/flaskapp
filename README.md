# The Movie Island
The project I chose to make is a flask app about movies, this app contains information about the best movie in each genre for 2018/2019.
It allows users to find movies and well as enter their personal favourites by simply signing up to the website. After they register, they can login to add new movies, edit their entries and even delete them.
The app is not overly populated with movies / movies' description for the users to find it easy to look for the movies and read about them.

# UX
This website is mainly for users who are looking for movies to watch when they can not think of any movie after a busy day. The movies section is divided into four genres and each genre takes them to the best movie of the year.
Other information is provided such as: director, release dates and duration etc.

Below are a couple of User experiences upon which the app was built:
1. As a user, I would like to share my personal favourites if they are not listed.
2. As a user, I would like the description to be short, so that I could decide which movie to watch quicker.
3. As a user, I would like to be the only one who can delete / update  my entries and also access my entries easier.

# Features:

# existing Features-
Navbar- allows the user to go back to the main page by either clicking on the logo or the home button.
About- talks a little about the idea of the app to help the user understand the idea behind it.  
Movies- this is where the genres are and by clicking on each genre, it takes you to the best movie.
Register section allows the user to create an account which will give them the ability to login and start making entries, edit / delete them too.
Once logged in, the user can find their entries on a dashboard in which they can make changes or enter new ones.
There is a logout button too, which only appears if the user is logged in. Just like the dashboard.
When the user chooses to logout, their entries are then shown along with the movie genres available on  the app and can be accessed.
Each user can: enter, delete and add movies.

# features left to implement-
I did not get the chance to make my navbar collapse when the screen size gets smaller.

# Technologies used
In this project I have concentrated on using MySQL and python.
MySQL is a relational database management system based on SQL â€“ Structured Query Language.
Python was used for developing desktop GUI application, website and web application. Also, Python, as a high level programming language, allows you to focus on core functionality of the application by taking care of common programming tasks.
HTML5 and JavaScript were also used to write the code for the webpages.
CSS framework - bootstrap was used for the layout of the app.
# Testing
This app was tested by inspecting it and using responsinator.com
I also tested it by creating multiple accounts and entering new genres, editing and deleting them to see how the app responds.
I also concentrated on the UX scenarios to make my app better, for instance, the app allows users to make their own entries, short description about each movie and they can CRUD after they make an account.

Make an entry :
1. Register
2. Login
3. Go to dashboard
4. Add Movie
5. submit
6. Movie appears on dashboard and  movies section
7. Edit and submit again to see changes
8. Delete and entry will be removed.

Contents of my flask app are fully visible on all screen sizes

Bugs:
 navbar Content that does not seem to show in collapsed menu on small screens.

# Deployment
The process of deploying the project to GitHub was as follows:
1.  successfully pushing the files to GitHub,start the deployment.
2. I went on settings and to the page section, changed the branch name to Master Branch.
3. A link was operated and that was the Live URL to my website.
Deployment: is making the website Live and accessible by anyone who opens the link provided.
Development: is using Git commands to upload the file used in the making of the website to GitHub in order to be downloaded or viewed by the assesor and checked.
To run my code locally, and ensure that it perfectly works, the user should download the source files used along with the HTML code and run it on their device.
